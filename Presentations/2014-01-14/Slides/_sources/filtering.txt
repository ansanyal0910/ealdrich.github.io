Filtering Methods for Volatility Estimation
===========================================

Motivation
==========

Volatility estimation has typically taken several forms:

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Computing the sample variance of historical data.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Computing implied volatilities using options.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Computing model-based values using GARCH or SV models.


Motivation
==========

Financial data has become more rich in the past two decades.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Intraday trades and quotes can be used to estimate volatility on a
  daily basis using only historical data (no model).


Prices
======

Prices are typically modeled as a continuous time diffusion:

.. math::

   dp(t) = \mu(t) dt + \sigma(t) dW(t)

where :math:`W(t)` is a standard Brownian motion.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- :math:`\mu(t)` is the drift and :math:`\sigma(t)` is the spot
  volatility.


Returns and Volatility
======================
Returns are the integral of price changes:

.. math::

   r(t) = p(t) - p(t-1) = \int_{t-1}^t \mu(s) ds + \int_{t-1}^t
   \sigma(s) dW(s)

.. rst-class:: to-build

Hence, the integrated variance is return variance between
:math:`t-1` and :math:`t`:

.. rst-class:: to-build

.. math::

   IV(t) = \int_{t-1}^t \sigma^2(s) ds


Realized Variance
=================
Realized variance (RV) is the intuitive discrete approximation to the
integrated variance (IV).

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Begin by dividing the time interval of interest, :math:`(t-1,t)`,
  into subintervals of length :math:`\Delta`.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- The realized variance is the sum of squared deviations from the
  mean:

.. rst-class:: to-build

.. math::

   RV(t,\Delta) = \sum_{j=1}^{1/\Delta} (r(t-1+j\Delta, t) -
   \hat{\mu}(t-1+j\Delta,t))^2.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- For short time horizons :math:`\hat{\mu}` is considered to be zero.


Asymptotic Realized Variance
============================
For the stochastic process specified above,

.. math::

   RV(t,\Delta) \to IV(t)

as :math:`\Delta \to 0`.


Microstructure Noise
====================
Unfortunately, as :math:`\Delta \to 0`, observed price data no longer
satisfy a diffusion process.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Bid/offer bounce induces a correlation structure and discreteness in
  the data that is typically referred to as *microstructure noise*.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- This has provided limitations on the frequency at which returns data
  can be sampled when used for realized variance estimation.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- The standard over the past decade has been to sample returns at
  5-minute intervals.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Sampling the data at finer frequencies can lead to severe bias in
  realized variance estimation.

Current Financial Data
======================
High-frequency trading and algorithmic trading have generated a wealth
of financial data in recent years.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Consider SPY, a very liquid ETF that tracks the S\&P 500.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- The average daily volume for SPY over the last three months is
  104,626,000 shares.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- This is comprised of roughly 250,000 individual daily trades (an
  average of 450 shares per trade, or so).

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Given 23,400 seconds in the trading day between 9:30 A.M. and 4:00
  P.M., that amounts to roughly 10 trades per second or 1 trade every
  100 milliseconds.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Quote data is probably 10 times as dense.


Data Loss
=========
Consider 5-minute RV.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- This estimator uses only 78 price observations over the course of
  the day to estimate daily volatility.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- This represents a data loss of 99.97%

.. rst-class:: to-build

- If we could optimally filter the microstructure noise, we could
  retain the informative part of each data point.


Filtering methods
=================
In the past couple of years, several papers have proposed filtering
methods.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- The most popular is the *realized kernel* estimator:

.. rst-class:: to-build

.. math::

   RK(t,H) = \sum_{-H}^H k\left(\frac{h}{H+1}\right) \hat{\gamma}_h.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- This is a special case of a smoothed estimator of the spectral
  density:

.. rst-class:: to-build

.. math::

   \hat{S}(f) = \sum_{-(N-1)}^{N-1} k\left(\frac{h}{H+1}\right)
   \hat{\gamma}_h e^{-i2\pi f h \Delta t}.


Filtering methods
=================
In practice, realized kernel estimators have been implemented with
Bartlett and Parzen filters.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- The Bartlett and Parzen filters were proposed for spectral density
  estimation in 1950 and 1961, respectively.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- New methods have been developed over the intervening decades.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- For example, multitaper estimation or estimation via wavelets.


Wavelets
========
A wavelet decomposition of a time series is an orthonormal, additive
decomposition.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Wavelet coefficients can be thought of as weighted averages of
  adjacent times series values.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- A wavelet decomposition is not unlike a spectral decomposition,
  except that the component series are related to varying time scales
  rather than varying frequencies.

Conclusion
==========
We believe that more advanced filtering methods may improve volatility
estimation with intraday data.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Bias and variance properties of RV estimators may be improved.

.. rst-class:: to-build

  - They may more optimally filter microstructure noise.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- Asymptotic convergence may be faster.

.. rst-class:: to-build

- As a result, we may be able to use data at finer sampling
  frequencies and even use finely sampled data to estimate intraday
  volatility (not just daily volatility).
