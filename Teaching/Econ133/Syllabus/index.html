           In this course we will analyze the structure and workings of
           financial markets. We will begin by studying the organization of
           markets from a broad perspective and then will learn the mathematics
           and models for valuation of specific asset classes. Topics will
           include risk-return trade-off, portfolio optimization, factor pricing
           models, fixed income securities, equity securities, and
           derivatives. The goal of the class is to give students a solid
           foundation of how financial assets are priced in the marketplace, and
           what questions investors should ask (both of themselves and their
           financial advisors) prior to making investment decisions.

         <div id="section">Course Materials</div>
         <div>
	   There is no required textbook for this course. A useful reference would
           be either <a class="body" href="http://amzn.to/1er1Dwq">Essentials of Investments</a>
           or <a class="body" href="http://amzn.to/1go9zjR">Investments</a>, but there is no need
           to purchase either of these texts. All course material will be made
           available via this website in the form of
	   <a class="body" href="../LectureNotes/">lecture notes</a>
	   and other free references on the internet
	   (such as <a class="body" href="http://www.investopedia.com">Investopedia</a>).

         <div id="section">Assignments</div>
         <div>
           There will be six assignments, assigned most Thursdays and due one week
           later. All assignments will be
           completed online using <a class="body" href="accepi.com">Accepi</a>. This
           service costs $9.95 for the quarter, but the expense is more than offset
	   by the fact that I am not requiring you to purchase a textbook.
         </div>
         <div id="section">Exams</div>
         <div>
	   There will be two exams:
	   <ul>
	     <li>Miderm: Thursday, 7 Feb 2019, in class.</li>
	     <li>Final: Thursday, 21 Mar 2019, 8:00 am - 11:00 am</li>
	   </ul>
	   There will be no make-up exams - it is your responsibility to arrange
	   your schedule to be present for the exams.
	 </div>
         <div id="section">Grading</div>
	 <div>
	   Assignments: 25%; Mid-Term Exam: 35%; Final Exam: 40%. I will curve grades
	   only at the end of the semester if the distribution is low enough and/or
	   spread out enough. It is important for me to emphasize that curving will
	   never hurt your grade - it will only work to your advantage.
