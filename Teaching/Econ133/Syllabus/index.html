           In this course we will analyze the structure and workings of the
           financial markets. We will begin by studying the organization of
           markets from a broad perspective and then will learn the mathematics
           and models for valuation of specific asset classes. Topics will
           include risk-return trade-off, portfolio optimization, factor pricing
           models, fixed income securities, equity securities, and
           derivatives. The goal of the class is to give students a solid
           foundation on how financial assets are priced in the marketplace, and
           what questions investors should ask (both of themselves and their
           financial advisors) prior to making investment decisions.

	   There is no required textbook for this course. A useful reference would
           be either <a class="body" href="http://amzn.to/1er1Dwq">Essentials of Investments</a>
           or <a class="body" href="http://amzn.to/1go9zjR">Investments</a>, but there is no need
           to purchase either of these texts. All course material will be made
           available via this website.

           There will be eight assignments, assigned most Thursdays and due one week
           later. The scores for only seven assignments will be used in your final
           grade computation - I will drop your lowest score. All assignments will be
           completed online using <a class="body" href="accepi.com">Accepi</a>. This
           service costs $20 for the quarter, but the expense is offset by the fact
           that I am not requiring you to purchase a textbook.
