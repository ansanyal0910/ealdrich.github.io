         <div>
	   This course deals with advanced topics in statistics/econometrics. It is motivated
	   by applications to financial engineering, but the methods and tools are applicable
	   to many other fields. Important topics include exploratory data analysis, empirical
	   distributions, the bootstrap, time series models, GARCH models and Bayesian methods
	   (including MCMC). Dr. Greg Laughlin will also provide several guest lectures on
	   related topics: distributions that occur in finance and in nature, the jackknife and
	   other resampling plans, working with tick data and the function of markets at the
	   microstructure level, simulated annealing, data snooping, hypothesis testing and
	   Occamâ€™s razor. This material will be good preparation for quantitative work in
	   finance as well as other jobs that require rigorous use of statistics. It will also
	   be good preparation for graduate coursework with a quantitative emphasis.

         <div id="section">Programming</div>
         <div>
	   We will use the <a class="body" href="http://www.r-project.org">R programming language</a>
	   to work with data and to solve problems. R is a free software environment used by
	   academic and professional researchers in statistics. Learning R will be a major
	   benefit to you if you pursue a career or graduate work in a quantitative discipline
	   that requires state-of-the-art data analysis.

         <div id="section">Course Materials</div>
         <div>
	   The textbook for the course is <a class="body" href="http://bit.ly/19b81tx">Statistics
	     and Data Analysis for Financial Engineering</a>, which is freely downloadable from
	   the previous link, provided you access that website with a campus IP address. I will
	   also make my <a class="body" href="../LectureNotes/">lecture notes</a> available on
	   this website.
         </div>
         <div id="section">Assignments</div>
         <div>
	   There will be four assignments, due every second Thursday (with an extra Thursday
	   to account for the midterm): 16 January, 30 January, 20 February and 6 March. Late
	   assignments will not be accepted and extensions will not be granted.
         </div>
         <div id="section">Exams</div>
         <div>
	   There will be two exams:
	   <ul>
	     <li>Miderm: Thursday, 6 February 2014, in class.</li>
	     <li>Final: Thursday, 20 March 2014, 8:00 A.M. - 11:00 A.M.</li>
	   </ul>
	   There will be no make-up exams - it is your responsibility to arrange
	   your schedule to be present for the exams.
	 </div>
         <div id="section">Grading</div>
	 <div>
	   Assignments: 25%; Mid-Term Exam: 35%; Final Exam: 40%. I will curve grades
	   only at the end of the semester if the distribution is low enough and/or
	   spread out enough. It is important for me to emphasize that curving will
	   never hurt your grade - it will only work to your advantage.
