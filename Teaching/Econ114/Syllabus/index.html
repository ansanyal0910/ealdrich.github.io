         <div>
	   This course deals with advanced topics in statistics/econometrics. It is motivated
	   by applications to financial engineering, but the methods and tools are applicable
	   to many other fields. Important topics include exploratory data analysis, empirical
	   distributions, the bootstrap, time series models, GARCH models and Bayesian methods
	   (including MCMC). As motivation for these methods, time will be devoted to studying
	   financial market design and financial market microstructure data. This material will
	   be good preparation for quantitative work in finance as well as other jobs that
	   require rigorous use of statistics. It will also be good preparation for graduate
	   coursework with a quantitative emphasis. As a 5-unit course, the non-lab portion of
	   the course should consist of approximately 15 hours of work per week, divided among
	   lectures, reading, assignments and exams.
         </div>
         <div id="section">Programming</div>
         <div>
	   We will use the <a class="body" href="http://www.r-project.org">R programming language</a>
	   to work with data and to solve problems related to methodology taught in lecture. R
	   is a free software environment used by academic and professional researchers in statistics.
	   Many students prefer to use <a class="body" href="http://www.rstudio.com">RStudio</a> as
	   an R programming environment. While I recommend installing R on your own machine, I will
	   make a server-based version of RStudio available that you can access remotely from any web
	   browser using your UCSC login credentials. Learning R will be a major benefit to you if
	   you pursue a career or graduate work in a quantitative discipline that requires
	   state-of-the-art data analysis.
         </div>
         <div id="section">Laboratory</div>
	   This course is paired with a mandatory lab component. The objective of the lab sessions is
	   to teach the fundamentals of R programming in support of the programming objectives outlined
	   above. The first lab sessions will focus on coding primitives (data structures, control
	   flow, etc.) and subsequent sessions will teach the necessary tools to implement the methods
	   taught in lecture. The weekly outline below lists the schedule of lab topics, paired with
	   the schedule of Econ 114 lecture topics. Students will receive a separate grade for the lab,
	   which will be entirely determined by attendance. As a 2-unit course, the lab portion of
	   the course should consist of approximately 6 hours of work per week, divided among
	   lectures and practice problems.

         <div id="section">Course Materials</div>
         <div>
	   The textbook for the course is <a class="body" href="http://bit.ly/2j4OQeQ">Statistics
	     and Data Analysis for Financial Engineering</a>, which is freely downloadable from
	   the previous link, provided you access that website with a campus IP address. I will
	   also make my <a class="body" href="../LectureNotes/">lecture notes</a> available on
	   this website.
         </div>
         <div id="section">Assignments</div>
         <div>
	   There will be four assignments, due every second Tuesday (with an extra week
	   to account for the midterm): 22 January, 5 February, 26 February and 12 March. Late
	   assignments will not be accepted and extensions will not be granted.
         </div>
         <div id="section">Exams</div>
         <div>
	   There will be two exams:
	   <ul>
	     <li>Midterm: Thursday, 7 February 2019, in class.</li>
	     <li>Final: Monday, 18 March 2019, 8:00 - 11:00 A.M.</li>
	   </ul>
	   There will be no make-up exams - it is your responsibility to arrange
	   your schedule to be present for the exams.
	 </div>
         <div id="section">Grading</div>
	 <div>
	   Assignments: 25%; Mid-Term Exam: 35%; Final Exam: 40%. I will curve grades
	   only at the end of the semester if the distribution is low enough and/or
	   spread out enough. It is important for me to emphasize that curving will
	   never hurt your grade - it will only work to your advantage.
