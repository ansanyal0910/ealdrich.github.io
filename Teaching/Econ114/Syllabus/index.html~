         <div>
           In this course we will analyze the structure and workings of the
           financial markets. We will begin by studying the organization of
           markets from a broad perspective and then will learn the mathematics
           and models for valuation of specific asset classes. Topics will
           include risk-return trade-off, portfolio optimization, factor pricing
           models, fixed income securities, equity securities, and
           derivatives. The goal of the class is to give students a solid
           foundation on how financial assets are priced in the marketplace, and
           what questions investors should ask (both of themselves and their
           financial advisors) prior to making investment decisions.

         <div id="section">Course Materials</div>
         <div>
	   There is no required textbook for this course. A useful reference would
           be either <a class="body" href="http://amzn.to/1er1Dwq">Essentials of Investments</a>
           or <a class="body" href="http://amzn.to/1go9zjR">Investments</a>, but there is no need
           to purchase either of these texts. All course material will be made
           available via this website in the form of
	   <a class="body" href="../LectureNotes/">lecture notes</a>
	   and other free references on the internet
	   (such as <a class="body" href="http://www.investopedia.com">Investopedia</a>).
         </div>
         <div id="section">Assignments</div>
         <div>
           There will be eight assignments, assigned most Thursdays and due one week
           later. The scores for only seven assignments will be used in your final
           grade computation - I will drop your lowest score. All assignments will be
           completed online using <a class="body" href="accepi.com">Accepi</a>. This
           service costs $9.95 for the quarter, but the expense is more than offset
	   by the fact that I am not requiring you to purchase a textbook.
         </div>
         <div id="section">Exams</div>
         <div>
	   There will be two exams:
	   <ul>
	     <li>Miderm: Thursday, 6 February 2014, in class.</li>
	     <li>Final: Friday, 21 March 2014, Noon - 3:00 P.M.</li>
	   </ul>
	   There will be no make-up exams - it is your responsibility to arrange
	   your schedule to be present for the exams.
	 </div>
         <div id="section">Grading</div>
	 <div>
	   Assignments: 25%; Mid-Term Exam: 35%; Final Exam: 40%. I will curve grades
	   only at the end of the semester if the distribution is low enough and/or
	   spread out enough. It is important for me to emphasize that curving will
	   never hurt your grade - it will only work to your advantage.
	 </div>
         <div id="section">Trading Simulator</div>
         <div>
	   We will make use of the
	   <a class="body" href="http://www.investopedia.com/simulator">Investopedia trading simulator</a>
	   to engage in an informal trading competition. The objective of the competition
	   will be to give you first-hand experience in the function of financial markets
	   and to guide our discussion of topics in class. Your trading performance will
	   not be graded, but you will be required to perform a minimal set of tasks in the
	   simulator for grade credit. The competition should be fun and I anticipate that
	   some students will spend more time using the simulator than others.
