	   The aim of the UCSC computational economics reading group is to teach
	   students how to compute equilibria in economic models that cannot be solved
	   analytically. In the Fall quarter, the reading group will focus on the basics
	   of computation: solving nonlinear equations, optimization, integration and
	   function approximation. In the Winter quarter we will use these numerical
	   tools to solve dynamic models, including standard macroeconomic models.

	   The primary textbooks for the reading group are
	   <a class="body" href="http://amzn.to/1wuKElq">Numerical Methods in Economics</a>,
	   <a class="body" href="http://amzn.to/1tp5cPn">Applied Computational Economics and Finance</a>,
	   and <a class="body" href="http://amzn.to/1syAilq">Dynamic General Equilibrium Modeling</a>.
	   The first book is the most complete reference, the second provides a softer introduction 
	   to most topics and the third contains a number of nice macroeconomic examples.
	   <a class="body" href="../LectureNotes/">Lecture slides</a> will be prepared and presented
	   by students and will be made available on this site.

	   Attendance is mandatory. In addition, students must participate in a lottery to
	   determine the student presenters each week. Students are expected to present
	   assigned materials each week, with illustrating examples, as well as to ask
	   questions and participate in discussions during the workshop. Instructors will
	   be present to help answer questions rather than to lecture.
