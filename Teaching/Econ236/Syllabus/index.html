         <div>
	   This is a masters-level course in the valuation and pricing of derivatives. We will study futures, swaps and options markets and derive pricing formulas for various classes of underlying assets and in a variety of cirumstances. We will dedicate a good portion of the course to pricing options, including a derivation of the Black-Scholes pricing formula, and will then study the implications for volatility estimation. The course content will contain much of the material related to derivatives that is tested on the CFA level-II exam.

         <div>
	   We will use the <a class="body" href="http://www.r-project.org">R programming language</a>
	   to work with data and to solve problems. R is a free software environment used by
	   academic and professional researchers in statistics. Learning R will be a major
	   benefit to you in your graduate studies and in your post-graduation career.

         <div id="section">Course Materials</div>
         <div>
	   There is no required textbook for the course. I will make my <a class="body" href="../LectureNotes/">lecture notes</a> available on
	   this website. However, my notes will closely follow the textbook <a class="body" href="http://amzn.to/1xIYSVK">Options, Futures and Other Derivatives</a> by John Hull. While I do not require that you purchase the text, I do recommend that you obtain a copy if possible, as the reading will help you gain a much greater depth of understanding and will assist you in preparing for assignments and exams.
         </div>
         <div id="section">Assignments</div>
         <div>
	   There will be four assignments, due every second Tuesday, starting in the third week of the quarter: 16 April, 30 April, 21 May and 4 June. Late
	   assignments will not be accepted and extensions will not be granted.
         </div>
         <div id="section">Exams</div>
         <div>
	   There will be two exams:
	   <ul>
	     <li>Miderm: Tuesday, 7 May 2019, in class.</li>
	     <li>Final: Tuesday, 11 June 2019, Noon - 3:00 p.m.</li>
	   </ul>
	   There will be no make-up exams - it is your responsibility to arrange
	   your schedule to be present for the exams.
	 </div>
         <div id="section">Grading</div>
	 <div>
	   Assignments: 35%; Mid-Term Exam: 30%; Final Exam: 35%. I will curve grades
	   only at the end of the semester if the distribution is low enough and/or
	   spread out enough. It is important for me to emphasize that curving will
	   never hurt your grade - it will only work to your advantage.
